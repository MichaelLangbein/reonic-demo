# Task description

You are tasked with visualizing the input parameters and the output.

The input parameters could be:

- the number of charge points
- a multiplier for the arrival probability to increase the amount of cars arriving to charge (20-200%, default: 100%)
- the consumption of the cars (default: 18 kWh)
- the charging power per chargepoint (default: 11 kW)

For the output, you could visualize:

- The charging values (in kW) per chargepoint at a useful aggregation level
- An exemplary day
- The total energy charged (in kWh)
- The number of charging events per year/month/week/day

Bonus:

- Create a UI to allow creating different types of chargepoints (e.g. 5 x 11kW, 3 x 22kW, 1 x 50kW).
- The deviation of the concurrency factor from the bonus task could be displayed (if the previous bonus task was completed).
